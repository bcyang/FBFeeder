# Facebook Feed Filter Safari Extension

I have lots of friends on FB (well, choice of social network for our era). I don't post but do check feeds to keep up with them.

However, more and more I'm feeling I'm at the mercy of Facebook of how many sponsor content they want to force-feed to me.

Armed the power of GPT, I wonder "how hard could it be to write a safari extension that can help me filter out those I don't want to see?"

Apparently not that difficult.


## Installation
1. use XCode to open this project
2. build it (yes, that's it, it will be available to be selected in Safari)
3. Open Safari, Preference > Advanced, enable "Show features for web developers" at bottom
4. Now you have Develop menu, Developer > Developer Settings..., enable "Allow unsigned extensions"
5. now you should have an icon appear next to the Address Bar


## Caveat

It works currently and will likely work until FB release another version of UI (that generates another random css style).
The keyword filter I use are too simplistic.

Well, I don't use FB enough to warrant more effort on this. Take it


## Credit
Not sure if it should go to GPT or wherever GPT scrap this from.
